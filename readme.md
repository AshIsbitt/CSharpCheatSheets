# C# Cheat sheets

The first cheat sheet in this repo was put together by following the "C# 101" series on the 
dotNET youtube series, which appears to be an official production from microsoft itself. I found
this series to talk you through the basics as if you had never touched any programming language
before, so to me it was a little slow as I have prior experience with Python. 

However, to work with dotnet and manipulate it in terminal, I had to turn to a previous pluralsight
course I have notes on (https://github.com/AshIsbitt/Intro_to_C-) as well as experimentation with
dotnet in terminal.

### Dotnet in terminal

* `dotnet new console` - creates a new console application with a pre-written Hello World program.
* `dotnet new gitignore` - generates a full gitignore file for all the files that `new console`
creates
* `dotnet run` - finds a `.csproj` file and runs all cs code it can find
